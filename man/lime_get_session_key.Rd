\description{
Open a LimeSurvey session to use the API. This needs to be calles before
everything else. A session key can only be obtained, if there are two
environment variables set: `LIM_USER` (the username for your account) and
`LIM_PW` (your password).
}
\details{
The session key is then saved as an environment variable, which is referred
to "under the hood".
